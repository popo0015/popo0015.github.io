            <h3>Programming experience</h3>
            <h3>What I have taught myself before coming in the Netherlands?</h3>
            <p>
                Programming has always been an exciting concept for me -
                my journey through programming began just like a hobby
                but soon evolved into a career dream. My coding path
                has been filled with engaging courses and hands-on experiences that
                have allowed me to explore various elements of web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                My programming journey kicked off with a solid foundation in HTML.
                I enrolled in various online courses, including those on Khan Academy,
                which provided a very structured way to learn the fundamentals.
                Gathering more knowledge and putting it into practice, I discovered
                the power of markup languages in transforming ideas into digital reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a solid grasp of HTML, my next logical step was to follow
                CSS. Understanding that the visual appeal of a website
                are just as important as its structure, I dived into CSS in order 
                to be able to visualise my creativity and imgaination. The connection between HTML
                and CSS became evident to me as I realized how these two languages 
                could work in harmony to bring web designs to life.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to web development, my programming journey also introduced me
                to the world of C++. During my high school years I managed to get a brief 
                idea of what C languages are and their usae. A dedicated lecturer provided me
                with a basic introduction to C++. Although  I haven't dived deeper
                into C++ since then, the minimal exposure to C languages was enough 
                to spark a will to learn how to build desktop applications and 
                better my knowledge in systems programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                My programming journey is far from over - it has just begun. I am determined
                to learn and explore. The knowledge I've gained in HTML and
                CSS has sparked my passion for creating digital solutions that make a meaningful
                impact. As I look ahead, I am eager to develope my programming abilities,
                explore new coding languages anad technologies, and embark on exciting programming adventures.
                With the foundational knowledge I've acquired and the passion that fuels
                my coding trip, I am motivated to tackle the challenges that
                await in my future in the vast world of programming.
