            <h3>Profession</h3>
            <h3>In which companies do I see myself in the future?</h3>
            <p>I am incredibly motivated and determined to growth within the huge IT world.
                My drive to learn makes me explore various faces of this
                field, with the ultimate goal of finding the area that resonates most with
                my passion. While my journey began with web
                development, a field I am genuinely passionate about, I aspire to dive
                deeper into the world of Software Engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                My plan for the future is to seek internship and job positions
                that will not only challenge me intelectually but also allow
                me to contribute to meaningfull projects. Formula 1
                has always been a source of immense enjoyment and inspiration in
                my life. I dream of reaching a level of personal performance
                where I can contribute to a Formula 1 team alongside the finest
                experts in their fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                This dream symbolizes the dedication and hard work I am prepared 
                to invest in my journey towards success. That is why I never 
                tell myself it is impossible - it is not an end-goal, or situation, 
                it is a long process of personal development and exploration. With each step 
                towards it, I am confident that I will uncover my genuine niche with 
                which I would be able to make a lasting impact on the world of IT and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is not in my nature to give up, nor to settle for less! I am striving 
                to learn and reach the level of those experts working in that field - that will 
                first be a fullfillment of a dream of mine but it will also be a 
                reflection of the hard work i am putting and i am willing to put in 
                so i can succeed. Keep my motto in mind:
            </p>

                In the following articles you will see my top 3 companies that I would 
                like to continue my career path with. You will understand about the work 
                culture of the teams and my motivation behind relating to their visions 
                for the future and technology development. Enjoy!

                    engine development, and performance enhancement are only part
                    of the developing areas in the team. With a staff size of
                    approximately 1,000 employees and a culture deeply

                    The multicultural mindset of the team and the diversity of experience
                    of all the employees has been the base for the construction of
                    Ferrari's honorable past and the dream of the future.

                    home regarding the mindset of employees but also
                    it would be a dream come true.
