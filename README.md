# Portfolio Website üåü

Welcome to the repository for my portfolio website, crafted with care during the initial two weeks of my ICT programme at HZ University of Applied Sciences. This project is a personal showcase, featuring a collection of my projects, skills, and a glimpse into my journey as an emerging developer.

## About This Project üìñ

In the beginning of my ICT adventure, I dived into the basics of web development and emerged with this portfolio website. It's built using:

- **HTML:** The skeleton of the website, defining its structure.
- **CSS:** The styling to make the website visually appealing.
- **JavaScript:** A touch of interactivity to engage visitors.

This website represents my first steps into web development, embodying my learning curve and dedication. Not only was it a monumental personal achievement, but it also earned me the top spot at our website fair later on‚Äîa moment of pride and a testament to the hard work invested.

### Features üöÄ

- **Home Page:** An introduction to who I am, complete with a professional photo and my motivation for studying ICT.
- **About Me:** A deeper dive into my background, interests, and hobbies.
- **Portfolio:** A curated gallery of my coding projects, each with descriptions, technologies used.
- **Dashboard:** A simple table that vizualizes my 1st year in ICT seperated by courses and exams.
- **FAQ** Popular questions students ask and their answers.
- **Blog Section:** Sharing insights, learnings, and experiences throughout my ICT journey.

### Reflections & Learnings ü§î

Creating this portfolio was not just an assignment; it was a journey of self-discovery, learning, and growth. It challenged me to apply theoretical knowledge practically, taught me the importance of design in user experience, and honed my problem-solving skills.

### Future Enhancements üîÆ

- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the website is accessible and visually appealing across all devices. In the 3rd block of the 1st year in this course, we learn to make the design more responsive and accesible by using PHP and Laravel as a framework.
- **Portfolio Expansion:** Continuously updating the portfolio with new projects and personal achievements.
