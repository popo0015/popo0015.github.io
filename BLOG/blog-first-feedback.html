            <h3>First feedback</h3>
            <h3>The feedback I have received the first 2 weeks in my HBO ICT programme</h3>
            <p>
                My 2-week journey in the HBO-ICT program has been nothing
                but exhilarating. WWhile on this educational
                adventure, I've come to realize that learning in a dynamic environment
                is a balance mix of attending classes and self study. Gethering with fellow 
                students and sharing the process of learning has risen the overall spirit of 
                everyone involved, has turned the learning collaboration into a fuel for our progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's clear that we all share a passion for technology 
                and a drive to excel - that surely is one of the best aspects of this 
                program. The collective energy is contagious, pushing us to 
                our limits and beyond. This commitment and determination is what sets the 
                tone for our learning journey, making learning in HZ an experience where 
                improvement is the norm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, collaboration isn't just encouraged; it's embedded in our
                daily routine. It's not uncommon for us to examine each other's
                websites without the other party knowing, all in the matter of gaining
                inspiration and sharing knowledge - a very valuable experience. 
                It has helped us uncover issues in each other's code, leading
                to constructive discussions on how to improve our work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feedback is an essential part of our learning process and specifically 
                in PCO. I've been fortunate to receive positive and constructive feedback 
                during these initial weeks. Regarding my work, I've received conformation 
                that I'm on the right track, which has indeed been a confidence booster. 
                The constructive feedback I've received about my website's 
                structure has been crucial in helping me establish my design's functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our program is also blessed with dedicated student assistants and knowledgeable
                teachers who are always open to our questions. They do not refuse to provide guidance
                and valuable insights into the efficiency of our code - helping us
                better our programming skills and problem-solving abilities. Their 
                support has been a valuable part of our learning journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, my first two weeks in the HBO-ICT program have been an amazing
                experience filled with determination, hard-work, and constructive feedback.
                I'm excited about the growth and progress that are an inevitable part of 
                a journey filled with dedication. It's clear we are all driven
                by a shared passion for technology and the immense support from everyone 
                will contribute to big results.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am excited for what is waiting in the future!
            </p>
