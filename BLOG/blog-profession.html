                    Organisation, time management, and team leading are skills I learned
                    from my parents. These traits have helped me go through many obstacles
                    and stay on top of my problems.

                <p>
                    I have learned to take every opportunity I am presented with because
                    we always learn more when we try and fail than when we do not even attempt.
                    Being organised, reliable and authentic has helped me build trust in people
                    around me, which is the first step towards getting closer to more
                    possibilities for development.
